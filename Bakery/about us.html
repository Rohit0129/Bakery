        <p class="text">
            The year was 1880. In the small coastal town of Thalasserry in north Kerala, Mambally Bapu  — a businessman who shipped milk, tea and bread to British troops in Egypt  — decided to set up his own little borma (bakery).

He had just returned from Burma, where he had mastered the art of biscuit making, and wanted to popularise baked goods among the local Malayalis (back then, there was just one other bakery in the country and it catered solely to the British).<br> <br>

So Bapu set up his small bakery, named it Royal Biscuit Factory and got to work. He began producing almost 40 different varieties of biscuits, rusks, bread and buns.
In 1883, a few days before Christmas, Murdoch Brown (a British planter who had started a cinnamon plantation at Anjarakkandy) got off his jadka (carriage) and walked into the bakery with a rich plum cake he had brought from England. He asked Bapu to taste the cake and asked him if he could bake one just like that.
