        <p class="text">
          The year was 1880. In the small coastal town of Thalasserry in north
          Kerala, Mambally Bapu — a businessman who shipped milk, tea and bread
          to British troops in Egypt — decided to set up his own little borma
          (bakery). He had just returned from Burma, where he had mastered the
          art of biscuit making, and wanted to popularise baked goods among the
          local Malayalis (back then, there was just one other bakery in the
          country and it catered solely to the British).<br />
          <br />

          So Bapu set up his small bakery, named it Royal Biscuit Factory and
          got to work. He began producing almost 40 different varieties of
          biscuits, rusks, bread and buns. In 1883, a few days before Christmas,
          Murdoch Brown (a British planter who had started a cinnamon plantation
          at Anjarakkandy) got off his jadka (carriage) and walked into the
          bakery with a rich plum cake he had brought from England. He asked
          Bapu to taste the cake and asked him if he could bake one just like
          that.
